    "# Q7. What are the advantages of using generator over regular functions?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "    Generator offers several advantages over regular function, particularly when dean dealing with large datasets or continiously streams of data,\n",
    "    rather than regular function that returns all results at once and consume memory for all the entire result set,\n",
    "    generator prodece values ondemand, using the yield keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages if using Generators over regular function:\n",
    "    1. Memory efficient(on demand generation)\n",
    "        Generators only produce one value at a time, which means they dont need to hold the entire sequence in memory.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "def my_generator():\n",
    "    for i in range (1, 1000000):\n",
    "        yield i\n",
    "'''\n",
    "here my_generator is generating a large sequence of value, but it will only product(generate) one at a time,\n",
    "regular function there, so it will all the values is stored in the memory at a time, \n",
    "so it will consume time to return and too stores in the memory , which not use the memory efficiently \n",

    "    *.Lazy Evaluation:\n",
    "        Generators follow lazy evaluation, meaning values are prduced only when needed, \n",

    "def lazy_number():\n",

    "    yield 2 #iterator that uses yield keyword\n",
    "    yield 3\n",
    "gen = lazy_number()\n",
    "print(next(gen)) #output: 1\n",
    "# in this as you generate thee next value using __next__() function, so you dont store all the values immediately in the memory.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "    *.State Retention without recursion overhead:\n",
    "        Generators maintain their state between yield call wihtout the need for recursion,\n",
    "        avoiding the deep recursion issues that regular functions might face.\n",
